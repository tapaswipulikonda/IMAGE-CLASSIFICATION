COMPANY : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME : Pulikonda Tapaswi

INTERN ID : CT2MTDM339

DOMAIN : Machine Learning

DURATION : 8 WEEKS

MENTOR : NEELA SANTOSH

# DESCRIPTION
this project is to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can classify images into one of several predefined categories. CNNs are particularly well-suited for image recognition tasks due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies in data.

# Tools and Technologies:
Programming Language: Python
Framework: TensorFlow / Keras
Libraries:
tensorflow – for model building and training
matplotlib – for visualizing images and training metrics
numpy – for numerical operations
